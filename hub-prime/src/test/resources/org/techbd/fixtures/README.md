## SHIN-NY FHIR IG test fixtures

- `happy-path` directory contains FHIR JSON Bundles that should "run clean" and generate no validation warnings or errors from the FHIR validation engines
- `unhappy-path` directory contains FHIR JSON Bundles that should deterministically generate validation errors based on "broken" content 

### "Happy Path" fixtures

Contains FHIR JSON Bundles that should "run clean" and generate no validation warnings or errors from the FHIR validation engines.

#### _Happy Path_ fixture naming conventions

The fixture file naming is as follows:

```<first-name>_<lstn-ame>_<family-name>_<bundle-id>.json```

For example:

For a fixture with the following data:

```json
{
  "id": "4d678b50-d57b-97cd-d8f5-97209d6b2e6d",
  .....
        "name": [{
                "use": "official",
                "family": "Kihn564",
                "given": ["Angele108", "Keitha498"],
                "prefix": ["Mrs."]
            }
        ]
  ..... 
}
```
The fixture file name will be: *Angele108_Keitha498_Kihn564_4d678b50-d57b-97cd-d8f5-97209d6b2e6d.json*

#### How to generate _Happy Path_ fixtures...
```
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```

Create a folder named `ig` in the synthea root folder and copy the implementatation guide json file to `ig` folder

```
mkdir ig
cd ig
wget -O StructureDefinition-SHINNYBundleProfile.json http://localhost:8000/ImplementationGuide/HRSN/StructureDefinition-SHINNYBundleProfile.json
cd ..
./run_synthea -ig ig/
```

The generated files will be in the `output/fhir` folder and copy the json with  file name format ```<first-name>_<lstn-ame>_<family-name>_<bundle-id>.json``` into  `happy-path` folder.

```
### "Unhappy Path" fixtures

Contains FHIR JSON Bundles that should deterministically generate validation errors based on "broken" content.

#### _Unhappy Path_ fixture naming conventions

```<first-name>_<lstn-ame>_<family-name>_<bundle-id>.json```

For example:

For a fixture with the following data:

```json
{
  "id": "4d678b50-d57b-97cd-d8f5-97209d6b2e6d",
  .....
        "name": [{
                "use": "official",
                "family": "Kihn564",
                "given": ["Angele108", "Keitha498"],
                "prefix": ["Mrs."]
            }
        ]
  ..... 
}
```
The fixture file name will be: *Angele108_Keitha498_Kihn564_4d678b50-d57b-97cd-d8f5-97209d6b2e6d.json*

#### How to generate _Unhappy Path_ fixtures...

```
git clone https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea.git
cd synthea
./gradlew build check test
```

Create a folder named `ig` in the synthea root folder and copy the implementatation guide json file to `ig` folder

```
mkdir ig
cd ig
wget -O StructureDefinition-SHINNYBundleProfile.json http://localhost:8000/ImplementationGuide/HRSN/StructureDefinition-SHINNYBundleProfile.json
cd ..
./run_synthea -ig ig/
```

The generated files will be in the `output/fhir` folder.

In order to make the Synthea generated output file invalid, follow the steps
1. Open ChatGpt 4
2. Upload the IG file, prompting - *Read this FHIR v4 Implementation Guide, to make the system learn the IG content.*
3. Go to the `output/fhir` folder and locate the file with the naming format - `<first-name>_<lstn-ame>_<family-name>_<bundle-id>.json`
4. Upload this file also to the Chat GPT, prompting - *Use this attachment as valid Synthea generated FHIR JSON which should pass the IG validation. Generate for me another JSON file based on this attachment with 10 errors introduced that would allow me to do a deterministic test of the IG validation using HAPI validation engine. and update the name of the file to summarize the nature of the errors you introduced.*

Download the file generated by Chat GPT and upload the same into  `unhappy-path` folder.
