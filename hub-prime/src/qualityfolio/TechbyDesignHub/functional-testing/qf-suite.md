## Scope of Work

The testing will cover the end to end functionality of the system.

### Functional Testing

- Verify the accuracy of each software function according to the defined
  requirements and specifications.
- Validate input and output parameters, ensuring they match expected results and
  conditions.
- Conduct boundary value analysis and test edge cases, such as empty inputs,
  invalid data, and other exceptional scenarios.
- Confirm the correctness and completeness of functionality by comparing actual
  results with expected behavior.
- Ensure proper handling of error cases like invalid credentials, missing data,
  or unexpected user interactions.
- Validate integration points between different system components to ensure
  seamless communication and behavior.
