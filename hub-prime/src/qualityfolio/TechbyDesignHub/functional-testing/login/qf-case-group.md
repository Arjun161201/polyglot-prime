### Overview

The login process is a critical component of an application or system that
ensures secure access for authenticated users. It involves validating user
credentials, such as a username and password, to grant access to the system or
specific resources.

- **User Authentication**: The system verifies the user's identity by checking
  provided credentials (e.g., username and password) against stored records.
- **Access Control**: Based on the user's credentials and role, the system
  determines the level of access (e.g., admin, regular user) to different
  resources or features.
- **Security Measures**:Login process incorporates security features like
  password encryption, multi-factor authentication(MFA), and session management
  to prevent unauthorized access.
- **User Interface**: The login screen provides an intuitive and user-friendly
  interface for inputting credentials, with clear error messages in case of
  failed login attempts.
- **Error Handling**: Proper feedback is given to users when login fails (e.g.,
  incorrect credentials or locked accounts), ensuring a smooth user experience.
