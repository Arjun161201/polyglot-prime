### Project Overview

This defines the framework for testing the functionality of the software
application. It outlines the testing scope, required resources, timelines,
roles, and associated risks. It ensures that the applicationâ€™s features perform
as expected, providing accurate and reliable results according to the defined
requirements.

### Scope

The testing will cover the entire functionality of the system.

- Functional Testing
  - Verify the accuracy of each software function according to the defined
    requirements and specifications.
  - Validate input and output parameters, ensuring they match expected results
    and conditions.
  - Conduct boundary value analysis and test edge cases, such as empty inputs,
    invalid data, and other exceptional scenarios.
  - Confirm the correctness and completeness of functionality by comparing
    actual results with expected behavior.
  - Ensure proper handling of error cases like invalid credentials, missing
    data, or unexpected user interactions.
  - Validate integration points between different system components to ensure
    seamless communication and behavior.
